        My name is Jordan Parra. I am twenty years old. I have two dog's named Ralphie and Fred. I also have a 7 month old niece named Lunna who I love alot! In my free time I like to spend time with family and friends. I also like to read and hike.

        I decided to join this bootcamp to start a career in web development. I gained interest in web development in highschool due to my computer class I had a couple years ago.. My computer teacher would tell me how great of a career path it is. My mom then found out about the bootcamp, and the rest after that is history. I'm ready for the challenge this class will bring. I know in the end all of it will be worth it.
